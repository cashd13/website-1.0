						In this example each column spans two units, making things a little more challenging than the three column grid. It splits up each column of a three column grid into two further columns. The six column grid provides you with more options and opportunities to fine tune smaller details. If you are working on a content-rich site and need to park a lot of information, a six column grid could be a smart starting point for experimentation. Since it maybe an advanced grid, I would maybe not recommend starting out with it on your first rodeo.
